### Wireframes

![Wireframe picture](./documentation/MS3.png)

It was recommended by my mentor to add a google map on the home page. 
I used the markers on the map to point to the parks locations giving the user an idea into the distance between them and the park they're interested in.
She also recommended a back to top button.
On my last mentor call it was advised to remove the first name row from my 'Register' and 'Log In' pages.
