## Introduction

(*![Apple Devices Picture](./wireframes/responsive.png))

This is my third milestone project; Designed to exhibit my capabilities and skills in javascript, as a student
of Code Institute. (https://codeinstitute.net/)
The goal was to showcase my skills to potential employers/recruiters, on a topic that I'm deeply interested in.
My project allows users to discover new walks within the UK, inspiring them to get outside and enjoy the beautiful English countryside.

(*Pages and what's on them)

The website is colourful and engaging, drawing the user in with bright, bold images and standout text, which I hope entices them
to get planning thier next walking route.
