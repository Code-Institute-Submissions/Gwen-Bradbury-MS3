## Testing

I carried our substantial testing on all of my apps pages and links.

1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ has been used to see how the site performs on different Apple devices and their viewports, all links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the AppleDevicesView.png at the top of this Readme.

2. **Laptop:**
    - Google Chrome Browser; all feature links and icons perform well on all viewport sizes. Developer tools were also used on browser for the various viewport sizes. 
The webpages are responsive as are the images, map markers, info windows and forms, whilst retaining user freindly design aspects.
* All buttons, markers and links were clicked and tested for responses, all form fields were filled out and responded as expected, all features were used and tested with appropriate responses given.
* All 'Delete' buttons delete the appropriate information.
* All nav links take the user to the page stated.
* The 'Edit' buttons take the user to a form with the fields filled out with the current information and the 'Edit' button within the form changes the information within the DB, before taking the user to the home page.
* The 'Cancel' buttons remove the user from that form without changing any of the information, or adding parks and walks to the DB. 
* The 'Add' buttons add the required park and walk information to the DB before taking them back to the 'Home' page. With the new park and walk visiable on the 'Home' and either 'My Walks' or 'Manage Parks' pages.
* **The buttons within the forms on and within the 'Manage Parks' section will take the admin back to the 'Manage Parks' page rather than the 'Home' page.**
* On the 'Login' page the button takes the user to their profile page upon correct entry of thier personal username and password, and the link to the 'Register' page transports the user to that page as expected.
* On the 'Register' page the button transports the user to thier profile page after registering their username and password. The link to the 'login' page also takes the user to that page as expected.
* The search bar at the top of the 'Home' page generates results based on user input. Results are listed underneath, and in the case that the search couldn't find a result to match that input a message will dsplay stating 'No Results Found!'. This has been tested using many 
related and unrelated words giving the correct response every time.
* The 'Reset' button resets the page back to it's origional state, listing all the parks and walks together.
* Flash Images give the user real time feed back on thier inputs and are visiable with bold, large text and contrasting background to grab the users attention. They show at the approprite time and with the correct text in all circumstances.
* The back to top button takes the user to the top of the current page and has been tested and reponded as expected on every page.

7. **Manual Testing**
    - Various browsers and devices; the project was shared in the peer-code-review CI slack room and was tested by other CI Students, Mentors, Alumni and Tutors. 
This is in direct relation to the 'Goals' and 'User Stories' from the 'UX' Section.
The results of this were -
        1. Users can easily understand the main purpose of the app.
        2. It's colorful and engaging.
        3. Users can add, edit and delete inputs easily.
        4. Users can find what they're looking for quickly and easily, using the navbar and search bar.
        5. The app is easy to use and has easy to follow instructions, with user feedback when an action has been carried out using flash messages.
        6. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user.
        7. Having the forms within the 'Edit' buttons autofill, saves user time and repetition.
        8. Links in the navbar are labelled clearly.
        9. The 'Top' button takes users back to the top of the page ensuring they always have somewhere to go and don't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
    
    - The register form was tested by the developer by trying to register an account using the wrong inputs to test validation and user feedback, which worked as expected. A red underline and text box appears alerting the user to the mistake.
    - Once registered the app then takes the user to thier personal 'My Walks' page. The users username appears at the top as programmed, along with a flash message stating registration was successful.
    - From here the developer tested the 'Home' nav link. This took the user to the 'Home' landing page.
    - On this page the search bar was tested firstly by entering information completely irrelevent to the site which showed the programmed message 'No Results Found!'.
    - Then words relevent to the site were searched all returning the correct information.
    - The developer tested the reset button, which returned all the walks to home page as expected.
    - From here the developer then clicked every arrow within the accordion to check that it responded correctly and displayed the correct information.
    - Scrolling to the bottom of the home page the developer checked to see that the park cards were displaying correctly with the correct information.
    - The google map was checked for correct marker pins. Every pin was clicked to confirm they could be opened and displayed the correct information.
    - The 'Top' button was then clicked to return the developer to the top of the page, which worked as expected.
    - The 'My Walks' link was then tested which takes the user to thier personal 'My Walks' page.

    - On this page the newly added walk is visiable under the 'All Walks' heading, and was tested in the search bar by entering the walks name and getting it underneath as a response.
    - The developer then clicked the 'My Walks' nav link again to check the newly added walk appeared thier as programmed. It was visiable and was clicked to ensure correct information was showing.
    - The 'Top' button was tested again on this page and gave the required action.
    - The 'Edit' button on this newly added walk was then clicked which takes the user to a form which allows editing of that input. The fields are automatically filled with the previous information as expected.
    - The dropdown menu was tested by clicking each park within it to be positive the field was inputted with the correct data.
    - The 'Top' button was tested again on this page and gave the required action.
    - Clicking update replaces the old information with the new on the 'Home' page and 'My Walks' pages with a flash message indicating success, and when clicking back onto the 'My Walks' page, the flash message has disapeared as expected. Clicking the cancel button takes the user to the 'Home' page without changing any of the information as intended.
    - The 'Delete' button will open a modal confirming deletion. Clicking delete will remove the walk from the DB, 'Home' and 'My Walks' pages. Pressing 'Cancel' takes the user back to the 'Home' page without making any changes as expected.

    - The 'Edit Park' button was clicked taking the user, as programmed, to an edit park form, which allows editing of that input. The fields are automatically filled with the previous information as expected.
    - The 'Top' button was tested again on this page and gave the required action.

THis provides the users with a flash message stating incorrect username and/or password.
    - Correct Log In information was then used which resulted in taking the user back to thier 'My Walks' page with thier username and walks visiable on it as programmed.
    - Admins have access to the 'Manage Walks' page. A second username was registered to check that the 'Manage Walks' page was hidden, and walks added by other users couldn't be edited, or deleted by another user. The new users username was visiable at the top of the 'My Walks' page and as expected the admin users added walks were hidden on it. The 'Manage Walks' page was also hidden successfully.

The developer used dev tools to check the resposiveness of all the apps pages, using the dropdown burger menu, which opened from the left as programmed, to click every page link. The 'Top' button was pressed on every page to test for the required action on smaller screen sizes, with the correct response given. The images were viewed and buttons all pressed on various browser sizes in dev tools to check responsiveness, along with forms and the search bar. All pages and thier contents were fully responsive whilst maintaining user friendly design aspects.
