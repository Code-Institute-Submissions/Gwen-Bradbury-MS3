## Testing

I carried our substantial testing on all of my apps pages and links.

1.  http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ has been used to see how the site performs on different Apple devices and their viewports, all links, icons performed as expected on all devices. I also used it to create the AppleDevicesView.png at the top of this Readme.

2. **Laptop:**
    - Google Chrome Browser; all feature links and icons perform well on all viewport sizes. Developer tools were also used on browser for the various viewport sizes. 
The webpages are responsive as are the images, map markers, info windows and forms, whilst retaining user freindly design aspects.
* All buttons, markers and links were clicked and tested for responses, all form fields were filled out and responded as expected, all features were used and tested with appropriate responses given.
* All 'Delete' buttons delete the appropriate information.
* All nav links take the user to the page stated.
* The 'Edit' buttons take the user to a form with the fields filled out with the current information and the 'Edit' button within the form changes the information within the DB, before taking the user to the home page.
* The 'Cancel' buttons remove the user from that form without changing any of the information, or adding parks and walks to the DB. 
* The 'Add' buttons add the required park and walk information to the DB before taking them back to the 'Home' page. With the new park and walk visiable on the 'Home' and either 'My Walks' or 'Manage Parks' pages.
* **The buttons within the forms on and within the 'Manage Parks' section will take the admin back to the 'Manage Parks' page rather than the 'Home' page.**
* On the 'Login' page the button takes the user to their profile page upon correct entry of thier personal username and password, and the link to the 'Register' page transports the user to that page as expected.
* On the 'Register' page the button transports the user to thier profile page after registering their username and password. The link to the 'login' page also takes the user to that page as expected.
* The search bar at the top of the 'Home' page generates results based on user input. Results are listed underneath, and in the case that the search couldn't find a result to match that input a message will dsplay stating 'No Results Found!'. This has been tested using many 
related and unrelated words giving the correct response every time.
* The 'Reset' button resets the page back to it's origional state, listing all the parks and walks together.
* Flash Images give the user real time feed back on thier inputs and are visiable with bold, large text and contrasting background to grab the users attention. They show at the approprite time and with the correct text in all circumstances.
* The back to top button takes the user to the top of the current page and has been tested and reponded as expected on every page.

7. **Manual Testing**
    - Various browsers and devices; the project was shared in the peer-code-review CI slack room and was tested by other CI Students, Mentors, Alumni and Tutors. 
This is in direct relation to the 'Goals' and 'User Stories' from the 'UX' Section.
The results of this were -
        1. Users can easily understand the main purpose of the site.
        2. It's colorful and engaging.
        3. Users can add, edit and delete inputs easily.
        4. Users can find what they're looking for quickly and easily, using the navbar and search bar.
        5. The app is easy to use and has easy to follow instructions, with user feedback when an action has been carried out using flash messages.
        6. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user.
        7. Having the forms within the 'Edit' buttons autofill, saves user time and repetition.
        8. Links in the navbar are labelled clearly.
        9. The 'Top' button takes users back to the top of the page ensuring they always have somewhere to go and don't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
